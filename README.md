# Python 3 Portfolio

Collection of my programming projects with Python 3. Updated as I complete them.

## Projects

* **Printify Pdf To Csv:** 
  Python code to scrape a one month pdf invoice from Printify to collect Net Amount Total (excl tax), Shipping cost, Tax, and  Total invoice amount into a csv file. I used *ChatGPT 4* for help and the notebook shows my work flow and how many different tries it took to find success. I included my pdf extraction code, which was the key to help GPT understand where to locate the desired headers and amounts.
* **Tic Tac Toe:**  Milestone project from Udemy Course by Jose Portilla of a simple Tic Tac Toe game
